> *"It's lit — on the web now."*  
> Welcome to the official portfolio of Travis Scott — if he was coding beats into pixels.

## 🎨 About the Project

This is a fully responsive, front-end portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — designed and coded by *La Flame* himself, reimagined as a web designer and developer.

The site showcases design skills, interactive effects, and visual vibes that reflect a modern, creative, and bold personality — just like the music.lll
